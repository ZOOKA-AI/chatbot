## Model Providers

This template uses the [Vercel AI Gateway](https://vercel.com/docs/ai-gateway) to access multiple AI models through a unified interface. The default model is [OpenAI](https://openai.com) GPT-4.1 Mini, with support for Anthropic, Google, and xAI models.

### AI Gateway Authentication

**For Vercel deployments**: Authentication is handled automatically via OIDC tokens.

**For non-Vercel deployments**: You need to provide an AI Gateway API key by setting the `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY` environment variable in your `.env.local` file.

With the [AI SDK](https://ai-sdk.dev/docs/introduction), you can also switch to direct LLM providers like [OpenAI](https://openai.com), [Anthropic](https://anthropic.com), [Cohere](https://cohere.com/), and [many more](https://ai-sdk.dev/providers/ai-sdk-providers) with just a few lines of code.

## Deploy Your Own

You can deploy your own version of Chatbot to Vercel with one click:

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/templates/next.js/chatbot)

## Running locally

You will need to use the environment variables [defined in `.env.example`](.env.example) to run Chatbot. It's recommended you use [Vercel Environment Variables](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/environment-variables) for this, but a `.env` file is all that is necessary.

> Note: You should not commit your `.env` file or it will expose secrets that will allow others to control access to your various AI and authentication provider accounts.

1. Install Vercel CLI: `npm i -g vercel`
2. Link local instance with Vercel and GitHub accounts (creates `.vercel` directory): `vercel link`
3. Download your environment variables: `vercel env pull`

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm db:migrate # Setup database or apply latest database changes
pnpm dev
```

Your app template should now be running on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Workspaces and plans

Every account receives a default workspace and can belong to multiple
workspaces. Workspace members have `owner`, `admin`, or `member` roles; owners
and admins can rename the workspace, manage member roles, add existing accounts,
and create seven-day invitation records. Pending invitations are not emailed or
self-service accepted yet. Chat and document data, subscription records, and
usage events are scoped to the validated active workspace. The initial `free`
plan tracks monthly chat messages (1,000 included); payment processing is not
enabled.

Apply `pnpm db:migrate` after setting `POSTGRES_URL` in `.env.local` to create
the workspace tables and backfill existing users, chats, and documents. Use
`/workspace` to manage a workspace and `/workspace/billing` to inspect its plan
and usage. New accounts and guest sessions are provisioned automatically.
